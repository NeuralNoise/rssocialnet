The output data from RsWall will be very similar to this.

Notation:
	Oject:
	{
		member: Type
	}

Identity: someone doing something like making a post, a comment or sharing something
Post: small piece of content. Can get commented, forwarded to friends and pinned on a Wall (or multiple Walls if desired).
Wall: place which belongs to an Identity. Own posts get pinned here, Friends can pin posts here.

Private Posts are very important.
Everything in the backend is prepared for this.
But unfortunately it is not completed yet.
